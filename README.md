## :computer: The Project

This initiative was started by [Rocketseat](https://github.com/Rocketseat) and inspired by the International Environment Week! Ecoleta is a garbage collection manager where companies will be able to create access points to certain types of garbage and users will be able to find the closest garbage collector company for their type of garbage and contact them either via e-mail or whatsapp via Ecoleta application. Overall, the purpose is to promote reutilization of old materials in an easy and efficient way to everyone!
